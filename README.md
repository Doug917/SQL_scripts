SQL_scripts

This is a collection of SQL code I've written.

The .py files are Python scripts with SQLite functionality for
pulling data and enabling advanced query functionality for data
at my current job.  The *HTML*.py script is for pulling
data from HTML table on private company site.  The SQL_QUERY and SQL_PLOT
files are for analyzing data pulled from SAP.
The primes.sql file is a procedure I wrote for making a table of prime numbers.
